                <p>We took the picture below on our way back from Plattsmouth Nebraska with 
                    a 1973 Dodge Charger.  This car has a 440 big block in it and is currently 
                    ready to go to the paint booth.  We have decided that we may just hold on to 
                    this one for awhile.  Never know though but it's kind of hard to store multiple 
                    18 foot long cars around the house.  Lol! </p>
