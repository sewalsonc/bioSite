                <p>Noah has a few good friends but no girlfriends, at least that 
                    we know of.  He spends the typical amount of time gaming 
                    and this time is as much gaming as it is spending time with 
                    his friends.  Noah has two sisters and sometimes he can be a 
                    nice brother and at other times not so much.  However, when he 
                    needs to show it he is caring.  Sometimes he and his sisters 
                    spend fun times together.</p>

                <p>He was around 7 or so when he got a little Honda 3 wheeler and even though 
                    he loved to ride it he seemed to like working on it as much or 
                    even more.  As he grew up he also moved up to dirt bikes then cars.
                    Noah loves working on just about anything with a motor but has been working 
                    on his 1974 Dodge Dart pretty much steady now for the last 4 or 5 months.  The 
                    picture above, Noah is finishing up on a rebuild of 350 cu in Chevy motor.  Still 
                    picked out what to put it in.  </p>

                <p>Noah’s second amazing talent is playing the guitar.  The guitar was 
                    kind of forced upon him at a young age and for many years it was 
                    more of a chore to “practice”.  From around the age of 9 he slowly 
                    picked it up more and more.  Noah had the opportunity to take 
                    lessons with Ron Emory of the band TSOL.  He became good friends 
                    with Ron’s son Jack and this was no doubt an inspiration.  </p>
