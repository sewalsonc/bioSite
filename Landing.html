            <p>Biography of a young aspiring talent.  Noah excels at anything 
                hands-on in school, so obviously reading and social studies are 
                not his strong suits.  Noah started taking things apart and trying to 
                figure stuff out at a young age.  Now at the age of 17 he has truly 
                found some passions to hopefully help him in his adventures.    </p>

            <p>In the picture below we were enjoying Tastees, a totally local place here in Sioux City,
                 known for their taverns and onion chips and dip (secret dip sauce).  We had just spent 
                 the last 2 or three hours looking at a 1967 Chevy Impala that he regrettably didn't buy.
                 "Can't get them all" I said.  For this one we waited month too long and it was gone.  Too 
                 bad as it was only $2400!
